  <div class="information">
<p> This restaurant is a staple in the Wellfleet Community, and it is representative of the history of the town, its residents, and its unique culture as well. The founders of Mac's Seafood Shack used to go fishing with their grandfather
at the crack of dawn right here in the Wellfleet Harbor. Years later, the two brothers made it their mission to fish with sustainability and traceability in mind, and help ensure
that the residents and visitors of their town shopped locally and healthily. This local, hardworking mindset exemplified by this pair of brothers
perfectly represents the Wellfleet culture, which is based upon the importance of family, the support of marine ecosystems, and longevity of local traditions. </p>

<!-- Drive-in Theatre -->


<p> This Wellfleet landmark is both a fun and functional remnant of a byegone era. Cars can very easily pull into parking spots in the theatre lot, and are then
free to relax while they watch the movie, socialize with other moviegoers, and attempt to keep the mosquitos away. Additionally, this space is repurposed as
flea market most Saturday and Sundays. Both the flea market and the drive-in theatre are iconic staples of the Wellfleet community culture because they provide
calm, easygoing outlets for relaxation and fun, and additionally patrons are always supporting local businesses when they partake in either activity. </p>

<!-- Newcomb Hollow Section -->

<div class="information">
<p> Newcomb Hollow makes up a large part of the federally protected Cape Cod National Seashore, and its sprawling natural dunes and miles of pristine shoreline are definitely worth protecting.
This beach is a hidden gem among Cape Cod locals, and its low profile helps maintain its relatively quiet and serene atmosphere. During the day, Newcomb Hollow is brimming with swimmers,
and sunbathers, but the life doesn't drain from the beach after the sun goes down. Rather, beachgoers are able to obtain permits in order to build bonfires on the beach, to which
families and friends bring s'mores, music, and often fireworks. The natural dunes of Newcomb Hollow are tragically disappearing due partially to erosion and additionally to the negligence of the
people who make the unfortunate choice to climb up the dunes or build structures too close to the crests. Hopefully the dunes will be preserved for many years to come.   </p>
